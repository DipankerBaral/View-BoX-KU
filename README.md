# ViewBoxKU
> This was our group project. For a communication to be complete there
  must exist two parties, nevertheless the traditional notice board system,
  had only half-duplex communication. There was no instant way of
  presenting the view on the particular notice. Taking that in account we
  designed and developed ViewBox-KU. In the Kathmandu University Boys
  Hostel (KUBH), we sometime come across issues of sanitation, internet,
  electricity etc. The ViewBox-KU allowed to mail and post complaint and
  suggestion about the existing issues to the warden of the hostel.
